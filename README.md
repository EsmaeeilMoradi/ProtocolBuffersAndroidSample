# ProtocolBuffersAndroidSample 

Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers. DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally.

Proto DataStore stores data as instances of a custom data type. This implementation requires you to define a schema using protocol buffers, but it provides type safety. We are going to use proto3 syntax, and you can find more information about it in the link below:
